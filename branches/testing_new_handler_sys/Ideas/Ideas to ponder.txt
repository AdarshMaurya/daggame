- A subset of the Baddies game.
- A creeping vine plant that is supossed to expand all over the world, like the influence in a civ game, but you reach certain areas that give you things, like water pools, or gnome settlements, and some others that are bad, like desert, it gets attacked by creatures... You "expand" over an area by keeping the finger presessed, and the vine appears and blooms all arround when you do that.
